## Thanks for visiting the site!

As of 15 Nov 2015, the server costs are being sponsored by [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com/), so there
is no further need for donations. The site will continue to run indefinitely.

Thanks to those who already donated, directly or through Lighthouse.
The [Lighthouse campaign](https://www.lightlist.io/projects/bitcoin-fee-estimation-server-costs-sep-oct-2015#)
failed to meet the target by the deadline, so please revoke your pledges!
