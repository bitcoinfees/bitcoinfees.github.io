## Thanks for visiting the site!

This is mostly a personal project. However, if you find the site useful, please
consider donating to support server costs (20 USD per month) so that I can keep on running it!

The fundraising for this site is done through the [Lighthouse app](https://www.vinumeris.com/lighthouse), two months (40 USD) at a time.

The current funding period is Sep-Oct 2015.
